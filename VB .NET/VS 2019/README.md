A small application for inserting maps to the Tiberian Sun Client (https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client).

Currently, the only way to add maps to Tiberian Sun Client is create an image preview of the map, add it to the next desired map folder together with map file itself and then insert the proper records in the "MPMaps.ini" file.

As you can see the process is quite convoluted, so I decided to make this application to easily add maps and create their previews at the same time. It's not heavily tested, so if it crashes during an insertion, you can take a look at the code and figure out why and where the crash occurs :)

Some QoL changes can be done so when I decide to come back to it, I'll see what I can do.
